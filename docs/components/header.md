# Header Component Documentation

## Overview
The header component serves as the top navigation area of the album clone application. It provides users with access to key sections of the application, enhancing usability and accessibility.

## Structure
The header component is structured to include the following elements:
- **Logo**: A clickable logo that redirects users to the home page.
- **Navigation Links**: Links to different sections of the application, such as the album grid and contact information.
- **Menu Button**: A button that toggles the visibility of the collapsible navigation menu on smaller screens.

## Props
The header component may accept the following props:
- `logoSrc`: A string representing the source URL of the logo image.
- `navLinks`: An array of objects representing the navigation links, each containing:
  - `label`: The text to display for the link.
  - `url`: The destination URL for the link.

## State Management
The header component manages the state of the menu visibility. It uses a boolean state variable to track whether the menu is open or closed, allowing for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Usage
To use the header component, import it into the desired parent component and pass the necessary props:

```javascript
<Header 
  logoSrc="path/to/logo.png" 
  navLinks={[{ label: 'Home', url: '/' }, { label: 'Albums', url: '/albums' }]} 
/>
```

## Styling
The header component is styled using CSS variables to ensure consistency with the overall design system. It is responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size, utilizing flexbox for alignment and spacing.

## Accessibility
The header component includes appropriate ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities. The menu button is designed to be keyboard navigable, ensuring all users can access the navigation options.
